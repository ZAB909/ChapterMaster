Version 0.6702

Hotfixes a critical error regarding not being able to save the game lol oops


----------------
Version 0.6701

changelog:

Hot fixed lamenters, they no longer get black rage, they have 2 strike cruisers, as well as 30 gene seed

buffed bolter just a little so it's actually better than a pistol

if your chapter master dies, game over!

-----------------
Version 0.67000

Hello I'm Zab1019. Head dev ( i guess) of the restoration and renewed development of Chapter Master

There's about 8 active contributors total. A few being artists, but mostly coders.

Our github is open source, and linked on our discord in our dev channels

Chapter Master Discord has made an open source project of this. Now titled "Chapter Master Adeptus Dominus"

We hope you enjoy the ride along this awesome project with us!

Discord:
https://discord.gg/zAGpqHzsXQ


Changelog:

++++
Added the Soul Drinkers:
They are daemon binder using, and soon shall turn renegade. Their numbers aren't great, but start with 60 gene seed, and 4 (FOUR!) battle barges!
++++

++++
Completely reworked the recruitment system for neophytes from the ground up.
Recruitment trials are mostly planet based, and none of them are strictly the best. They all have their own different scenarios where they are good.
If a planet has under 50% of it's max possible population, you recruit 20% less neophytes from there.
Currently there's no way to increase pop on a planet you have, but will be added soon.
++++

----
Hives by far have the most recruits, but very little exp
Lava,death, ice, and desert have the least, but have more exp
everything else is in the middle
----

----
xp and promotion amounts have been reworked, reminder you can simply disable requirements in chapter settings. But you cannot for terminators or thunder hammers

terminators = 180
thunder hammers = 140

1st: 150
2nd: 120
3rd: 110
4th: 100
5th: 80
6th: 70
7th: 60
8th: 50
9th: 40
----


A decent amount of enemies have been rebalanced. Expect ground combat to be harsher. A more thorough rework is still due for ground combat

++++
The marine's equipment has been entirely redone. Now mostly more expensive, but more worth it.
Duel wielding has been reduced massively. No longer will you be able to have a heavy bolter and a chain sword. 
Some exceptions exist. Such as axe's purpose now is to be duel wielded, or be used with heavier things.
++++

Chaos marines equipment has been matched to be the same or slightly better than the player's 

++++
Rhinos,predators,whirlwhinds,dreadnoughts and land raiders can now have sponsons, turrets, mounts and launchers. 
Customised with different weapons (plasma sponsons, heavy bolter sponsons, lascannon sponsons, ect.)
++++

----
Made tau a confirmed spawn 100% of the time. Also increased numbers massively. They can have 3-7 planets at start

Increased mechanicus planet spawn rate. 2-6 planets tops. Rarely get's 6 though
----


++++There are now three different types of chaos cults:++++

Stronghold worlds are somewhat rare, but incredibly powerful. They are named systems (Isstvan, Badab, ect.) and start spawning fleets straight away. Their corruption and traitor presence is rampant. Deal with them quickly!

Rebellion cults are worlds that haven't won over the planet's government yet, but shall within a few dozen turns. They have their name already changed to that colour at game start, so you can tell easily.

Underground cults are the old version of them. You'll only know they exist on a planet via PDF being killed. Rarer than the other forms but still present.


----
Many things in the code have been improved upon, and bugs fixed. Which makes our lives easy as coders. Also did I mention we are open source? Just join and help us in the discord link above!

-Choosing random will now give you advantages and disadvantages (Source Error, incomplete content)


Version 0.6600 GMS2
Notes
-With the conversion to GMS2, I cannot guarantee stability.  I am only 90% confident nothing of note is broken.

Fixed
-Crash caused by getting the STC bonus to vehicle accuracy ad then sending vehicles into combat.
-Crash caused by a typo in obj_turn_end_Alarm_0 when Orks invaded.
-Transfer showing empty boxes for unit roles company screen.
-Ship/world names overlapping with armour in company screen.

-Splintered ships on creation to now work as intended (I think it's being weird).
-Changed the range of boarding to the max range on the parent ship.

Changes
-Made it, so you always get loot after you clear a space hulk and added a small chance to get Tartaros armour.

-Changed how company screen logic works D

	--If none are selected, the group with the most units at a location will be selected.
-Made planets random features (????) generate on creation, but also made more of on gen. (Will be adding more options at a later date.)
-Added symbols on the planets when they have features of interest or require help. (! Coloured threats)
-Activated "Cave Network" planetary feature, however temporarily make it equal to Ancient Ruins.
-Assault a Necron tomb without a mission, land troops, end turn. (requires plasma bomb, still decent chance of failure)

Code Changes
-Refactored unit selection and unit selection buttons on the company screen. 
-Converted project from GMS 1.4 to GMS 2.

-Increased the max number of promotion options that "can" be shown from 6 to 9.

	-HQ Honor guard=120.

-------Cheats--------

-Several cheats can be toggled on and off, just repeat the same cheat.
-Several cheats use numbers eg: to use "req#" you could type "req10000"
-To start once on the sector/map screen press "p", then enter text that is before the = sign.

infreq = Toggle infinate requisition
infseed = Toggle, gain 9999 geneseed.
debug = Toggle debugmode, use at your own peril.
		(Right click on sector map to create/destroy fleets/invasions)
		(On planet view, increase or decrease forces)
		(On Armanentarium screen add STC research for free)
test = Test dialogue, dont use.
req# = Set requisition to # amount
seed# = Set geneseed to # amount
recruit# = Created # of recruits with 20xp, that will be ready in one turn (No extra equipment)

*Note all deposition cheats can be negative and are capped between -100 and 100.
*Deposition has the format of "depXYZ#" where XYZ is the first 3 letters of a factions name.
*EG: "depimp100" sets deposition with the imperium to 100; whereas, depimp-100 sets it to -100.
depall# = Set deposition of all factions to an amount.
depimp# = Imperium
depmec# = Mechanicus
depinq# = Inquisition
depecc# = Ecclesiarchy
depeld# = Eldar
depork# = Ork
deptau# = Tau
deptyr# = Tyranids, this probably wont do anything.
depcha# = Chaos
