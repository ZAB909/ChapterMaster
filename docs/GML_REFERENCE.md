## Comparison: GML vs JavaScript

| JavaScript | GML |
|---|---|
| `this` | `self` |
| `object` / `{}` | `struct` |
| `number` | `real` |
| distinct `boolean` type | `bool` values are `real` (1/0) |
| `null` | `pointer_null` |
| `Infinity` | `infinity` |
| `typeof x` - operator | `typeof(x)` - function |
| `x instanceof y` - operator | `instanceof(x, y)` - function |
| `/** */` JSDoc | `///` JSDoc |
| `class` | `function ... constructor` + `new` |
| `var`, `let`, `const` | `var` only |
| Block scoping with `let`/`const` | Function-level only |
| closures: inner functions capture enclosing locals | no closures - a method captures only `self`, never enclosing locals (see [Methods and Binding](#methods-and-binding)) |
| No preprocessor | `#macro` for compile-time constants |
| `a.length`, `s.length` | `array_length(a)`, `string_length(s)` |
| `obj["key"]` | `struct[$ "key"]` |
| `^` - bitwise XOR only | `^^` - logical XOR |
| `0x` hex prefix | `$` hex prefix |
| `switch` - fallthrough (uses `break`) | `switch` - fallthrough (uses `break`) |
| `do...while(condition)` | `do...until(condition)` |
| no equivalent | `repeat(n) { }` |

## Asset Types

GameMaker projects consist of globally referenceable assets.

The primary code-carrying assets:

### Scripts

- Functions and enums defined at the top level are **globally available** - no import/export statements.
- Loaded early in boot; function definitions are hoisted before any script statements execute.

### Objects

Objects in GameMaker are **blueprints** (similar to JavaScript classes) from which **Instances** are spawned at runtime. Each Object asset defines:

- **Events** - a set of named code blocks that the engine calls automatically under specific conditions. Think of them as predefined lifecycle methods that GameMaker's runtime invokes for you:
  - `Create` - runs once when an instance is first created (like a constructor).
  - `Step` - runs every frame (like an `update()` loop).
  - `Draw` - runs every frame when the instance is visible (like a `render()` method).
  - `Alarm` - timed callbacks, set with `alarm[0] = steps;`.
  - Collision events, Input events, etc. - triggered by engine-detected interactions.
- **Built-in Instance Variables** - every Object comes with a rich set of default fields (e.g., `x`, `y`, `speed`, `direction`, `image_index`, `visible`, `solid`). These are analogous to predefined properties on a class that the engine uses for movement, rendering, and collision.
- **Inheritance** - Objects can have a **Parent** Object. A child inherits all events and instance variables from its parent, and can override them by defining its own events. The child's events can call the parent's version with `event_inherited()`.

---

## Syntax Basics

### Comments

```gml
// Single-line comment
/* Multi-line comment */

/// @param {real} value
/// @returns {bool}
```

### Naming

- Alphanumeric characters and underscores only; first character must not be numeric.
- Names are globally scoped for functions, scripts, assets.
- Built-ins are almost always `snake_case`.

### Data Types

| Type | Notes |
|---|---|
| `real` | All numeric values (integers and floats). |
| `boolean` | `true` / `false` constants. Internally stored as `real` (values <= 0.5 are `false`, > 0.5 are `true`). Convert with `bool(x)`. |
| `string` | Double quotes **only** (`"text"`, not `'text'`). Positions are **1-indexed** (unlike arrays). |
| `array` | 0-indexed by default. 1-indexed is an optional project-wide setting. |
| `struct` | Key-value data structure (~ JS `Object`). |
| `function` / `method` | First-class; can be stored in variables and passed as arguments. |
| `int64` | 64-bit integer, used for bitwise results and handles. |
| `pointer` | Memory address; used only in specific native-function contexts (`buffer_get_address`, etc.). |
| `handle` | 64-bit reference to assets, instances, buffers, data structures, etc. |


### Built-in Constants & Special Values

GML provides several built-in constants. Some act as special data type values, while others act as sentinels for instances and contexts.

| Value | Category | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `true` / `false` | Boolean | Resolves to `1` and `0`. |
| `undefined` | Special Value | Uninitialised variable value. Falsy. |
| `NaN` | Special Value | Not-a-number. Not equal to itself (`NaN == NaN` -> `false`). |
| `infinity` | Special Value | Positive infinity (all lower-case). |
| `pi` | Math Constant | 3.14159... |
| `pointer_null` | Pointer | Null pointer (~ JS `null`). Falsy. |
| `pointer_invalid` | Pointer | Invalid pointer sentinel. |
| `noone` | Instance Sentinel | "No instance" (legacy value: `-4`). Returned by collision/instance functions when nothing is found. |
| `all` | Instance Sentinel | "All instances" (legacy value: `-3`). Used in `with()` or instance functions to target everything. |
| `self` | Context | Current context struct/instance (legacy value: `-1`). |
| `other` | Context | Other context (event-triggering instance, legacy: `-2`). |
| `global` | Context | The global struct. |

### Operators

- **Standard:** `+`, `++`, `-`, `--`, `*`, `/`, `%` (`mod`), `div` (integer division), `&&` (`and`), `||` (`or`), `^^` (`xor`), `!` (`not`).
- **Ternary:** `condition ? true_val : false_val`
- **Comparison:** `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `==`, `!=`
- **Nullish coalescing:** `??`, with assignment `??=`
- **Bitwise:** `|`, `&`, `^`, `<<`, `>>`
- **Compound assignment:** `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `|=`, `&=`, `^=`, `??=`
- **Literal prefixes:**
  - Binary: `0b10` -> `2`
  - Hex: `0x001122` or `$001122`

### String Interpolation

```gml
$"Hello {name}" // Template string
string("text {0} and {1}", a, b) // Deferred placeholder substitution
```

---

## Variable Scope

GML has three primary runtime scopes. At runtime, variable names are resolved in this order (the first match overshadows):
1. **local**
2. **instance**
3. **global**
4. **built-in**

### Local Scope

- Bound to the current function body or event.
- Control-flow blocks (`if`, `for`, `switch`, `try`) do **not** create a new local scope.
- Methods created inside a function do **not** inherit its locals - GML has no closures (see [Methods and Binding](#methods-and-binding)).

### Instance Scope

- Bound to the executing object instance or struct.

**Context Keywords: `self` and `other`**

GML uses `self` and `other` to manage scope dynamically.

`self` is the GML equivalent of `this` in JavaScript, referring to the **current scope** of the code being executed.

`other` refers to the **previous scope** before `self` was changed. 

Their behavior is context-dependent:

| Context | `self` refers to... | `other` refers to... |
|---|---|---|
| **Collision Event** | The current instance. | The other instance involved in the collision. |
| **`with` statement** | The instance or struct passed to `with`. | The instance or struct that executed the `with` block. |
| **Method / Constructor** | The instance or struct the function is bound to or called on. | The caller of the method/constructor (not the bound context). |
| **Struct literal body** | The struct being defined. | Usually the same as `self`. |
| **Accessor chain** | Implicitly follows the accessed value. | Usually the same as `self`. |
| **Elsewhere** | The current instance or struct. | Usually the same as `self`. |

### Global Scope

- Global functions (scripts), `global.` struct, and `enums` are accessible from anywhere in the code.

---

## Variable Categories

While scope defines *where* a variable can be accessed, GML features distinct categories of variables based on how they are initialized and stored.

### Local

- Declared with `var`.
- Scoped to the **function or event body**, not to individual blocks.
- Exists only during the current function or event execution.

### Instance

- Declared without a keyword (e.g., `hp = 100;`) or via context (`self.hp = 100;`).
- Bound to the lifetime of the specific instance or struct.

### Static

- **Initialized Once** on the first function (`constructor` functions included) call and stored in the function's static struct.
- **Persists** across calls without polluting instance memory.
- **Hoisting:** Initializers run at the top of the function body before any standard code executes.
- **External Access:** Accessible via `function_name.variable`, but the function **must execute at least once** first to instantiate its static struct.
- **Inheritance:** Reading traverses child-to-parent static structs. Writing via a child constructor assigns directly to the child static struct without modifying the parent.

### Global

- Declared on the `global` struct (e.g., `global.score = 0;`).
- Accessible from anywhere.
- The `global` struct acts as a de facto application singleton.

### Constant

**Enums:** Named integer constants. Values start at 0 and auto-increment.
```gml
enum COLORS {
    DARK_RED,
    BLUE,
    GREEN
}
```

### Compile-Time

Not true variables in the runtime memory sense, but named values resolved at compile-time. They are globally available and not tied to any struct.

- **Asset IDs:** References to objects, sprites, sounds, etc. (e.g., `obj_player`).
- **Function identifiers:** The names of globally hoisted script functions.
- **Macros:** Compile-time textual replacement.
  - **Do not** use for arrays; each reference creates a new array instance.
  - **Do not** add `=` during assignment, or `;` at the end.
  - Can span lines with trailing `\`.
```gml
#macro SFX_CLICK "click_sound.wav"
#macro MAX_HP 100
```

---

## Functions

### Declaration

```gml
// Named function (hoisted in Script assets)
function do_something(_arg1, _arg2) {
    return _arg1 + _arg2;
}

// Anonymous function (method)
var _fn = function(_x) { return _x * 2; };
```

### Default Arguments

```gml
function greet(_name = "Unknown") {
    return $"Hello {_name}";
}
```

### Hoisting

Functions defined at the top level of **Script** assets are hoisted globally during boot before any script statements execute (cross-script circular references work). See [Assets](#assets). Functions defined inside Objects or nested blocks are **not** hoisted.

### Returning

- `return` exits the function and returns a value.
- `exit` exits the current event or script immediately without a value.

### Static Struct

Every function has an associated static struct where its `static` variables live. You can retrieve or replace this entire struct using built-in functions:

- `static_get(function)` - Returns the static struct of the function.
- `static_set(function, struct)` - Overwrites the function's static struct.

---

## Constructors

GML uses **constructor functions** with the `constructor` keyword instead of JS classes. Called with `new`.

```gml
function Marine(_name, _chapter) constructor {
    name = _name;
    chapter = _chapter;

    static greet = function() {
        return $"For the {chapter}!";
    };
}

// Inheritance (equivalent to JS `extends`)
function Apothecary(_name) : Marine(_name) constructor {
    static heal = function() { /* ... */ };
}

var _marine = new Marine("Brother Cassius", "Ultramarines");
```

- Inside a constructor, `self` refers to the struct being created.
- Constructor functions are globally available like any script function.
- Use `static` for methods inside a constructor. This attaches the method to the constructor's static struct once, rather than copying it into every new instance (similar to JS prototype methods).

---

## Methods and Binding

In GML, a **method** is a function that is bound to a specific context (a struct or instance), meaning `self` inside the function refers to that context. 

There are two ways to create a method:

### 1. Implicit Binding (Standard Methods)
When you define a function inside a struct or constructor, GML automatically binds it to that struct. This is the standard way to create methods, similar to JavaScript.

```gml
// Using a struct literal
var _my_struct = {
    hp = 100,
    get_hp = function() { return self.hp; }
};

// Using a constructor (best practice for instances)
function Player() constructor {
    hp = 100;
    
    // Static ensures the method is created once, not copied per instance
    static get_hp = function() { 
        return self.hp; 
    };
}
```

### 2. Explicit Binding (The `method()` Function)
You can explicitly bind an existing, unbound function to a specific context using the built-in `method()` function. This behaves like JavaScript's `Function.prototype.bind()` and is useful for callbacks or assigning methods dynamically.

```gml
var _context = { name: "Cassius" };
var _unbound_fn = function() { return self.name; };

var _bound = method(_context, _unbound_fn);
// _bound() will return "Cassius"
```

> [!WARNING]
> **No local-scope closures.**
> Unlike JavaScript, a method does NOT capture the local variables of the function it was created in. When the method runs later, name resolution starts at its own locals, then its bound context (`self`), then globals and built-ins. Reading an outer local from inside a callback fails (or worse, resolves to a same-named variable in the method's own scope chain) - typically a "variable not set" error.
>
> Carry the values on a context struct and bind with `method()`:
> ```gml
> function fetch_report(_error) {
>     var _ctx = { error: _error };
>     var _req = new Request();
>     _req.setCallback(method(_ctx, function(_result, _request) {
>         process(self.error, _result); // self.error works, _error does NOT
>     }));
> }
> ```

**Quirks of `method()` and Static Structs:**
When using explicit binding via `method()`, there are specific rules regarding static structs:
- Methods share the **static struct** of the original function they were created from. Chaining `method()` on a method still shares the original function's static struct.
- `static_get(the_method)` returns the **actual** static struct of the function behind the method (not a copy).
- `static_set(the_method, struct)` has **no effect** - the static struct of the function behind a method cannot be replaced.
- Variables attached directly to a method via `.` accessor (e.g. `_bound.tag = "x"`) are stored opaquely - not in the static struct.

## Data Structures and Accessors

> [!NOTE]
> No native properties (like `.length`), use built-in functions.

### Arrays

```gml
var _arr = [10, 20, 30];
_arr[0] = 25;           // 0-based indexing (default)
_arr[1] = 35;
array_push(_arr, 40);   // Push to end
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Copy on Write:** This project has `option_copy_on_write_enabled: true`. When an array is passed into a function, modifying it inside the function creates a temporary copy unless the `@` accessor is used:
```gml
function modify(_arr) {
    _arr[@ 1] = 200;    // Bypasses CoW, modifies original
    _arr[1] = 200;    // Creates a copy, reference lost
}
```

### Structs

```gml
var _s = { name: "Cassius", hp: 100 };

_s.name;              // Dot accessor
_s[$ "name"];         // Struct accessor (bracket with $)
```

### Legacy DS Structures

> [!WARNING]
> DS structures don't have native garbage-collection, and must be manually destroyed with `ds_destroy()` or they leak memory. As such, GML documentation recommends arrays and structs instead of `ds_list`,  `ds_map` and `ds_grid`, where possible.

| Type | Accessor | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `ds_list` | `[\| index]` | Ordered collection of values, accessed by numeric index (old-style array). |
| `ds_map` | `[? key]` | Key-value pairs (dictionary / hash map). An important quirk: unlike structs, the key isn't limited to strings and can be of any type, including a struct. |
| `ds_grid` | `[# x, y]` | 2D grid of values, accessed by column and row coordinates. |
| `ds_stack` | Built-in functions | LIFO (last in, first out) collection; push and pop. |
| `ds_queue` | Built-in functions | FIFO (first in, first out) collection; enqueue and dequeue. |
| `ds_priority` | Built-in functions | Collection of prioritized values, popped in priority order. |

---

## Garbage Collection and Object Lifetime

GML features automatic garbage collection (GC) for structs and instances. An object becomes eligible for garbage collection when there are no **strong references** remaining to it. A strong reference is any variable that directly holds the object (e.g., `my_instance = instance_create(...)`).

### Weak References: `weak_ref_create`

To hold a reference to an object **without** preventing its garbage collection, use `weak_ref_create`. This returns a special **weak reference struct**.

**Key Behavior:**
- The weak reference struct contains a `ref` variable. Accessing it yields the **strong reference** to the original object if it still exists, or `undefined` if it has been garbage collected.
- Use `instanceof()` to identify a weak reference (`"weakref"`) versus a strong reference (`"struct"` or a constructor name).
- **`weak_ref_alive`** can be used to check if the tracked object is still alive.

**Example:**
```gml
// Create a weak reference to an inventory struct
inventory_ref = weak_ref_create(inventory); // Returns a weak reference struct

// ... later, in another script or frame ...
if (weak_ref_alive(inventory_ref)) {
    // Safe to use the strong reference stored in .ref
    show_debug_message($"Items: {array_length(inventory_ref.ref.items)}");
} else {
    show_debug_message("Inventory has been destroyed.");
}
```

### Common Pitfalls & Best Practices

1. **Accidental Strong References**: Storing a direct reference in a long-lived structure (like `global`, `static`, or an array in a persistent object) will **prevent garbage collection** of that instance.
2. **Checking Existence**: Always check for existence before using an instance reference, especially if it might have been destroyed since you last saw it.
   - **For strong references**: Use `instance_exists(instance_id)`.
   - **For weak references**: Use `weak_ref_alive(weak_ref)` or check `is_struct(weak_ref.ref)`.
3. **Use Case - Event Listeners**: When a system (e.g., a UI element) subscribes to events from another system (e.g., a game manager), it should use a weak reference. This allows the UI element to be destroyed without leaving a dangling reference in the game manager's listener list.
