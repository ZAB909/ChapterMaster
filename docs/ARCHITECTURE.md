# Useful functions:

## Common functions 
Creating a Marine
```gml
/// @function TTRPG_stats
/// @description creates a new unit struct see scr_marine_struct.gml for more info
/// @param {array} rect x1, y1, x2, y2 array.
/// @returns {bool}
function TTRPG_stats(faction, comp, mar, class = "marine", other_spawn_data={})
```
Display a marine's role
```gml
/// provides a string representation of the unit name combined with the unit role 
/// taking into account the unit role display name as provided by the units squad type
unit_Struct.name_role()
```
Get a random marine with filter
```gml
/// selects a random player unit within the parameters given
/// @param {Real|Array[Real]} role id or list of ids e.g. 2 = Honour Guard
/// @param {Real} exp_req minimum exp requirement
/// @param {String|Struct} search_params attributes to search for
/// if params is a struct, can use traits or stats as part of the search
/// if no marine is available with give parameters returns "none"
function scr_random_marine(role, exp_req, search_params="none")
/// @example - finding a random chaplain candidate
```

## Visual and draw functions

Click handling
```gml
/// @function point_and_click
/// @description Returns true if left mouse button was clicked on the desired rectangle area.
/// @param {array} rect x1, y1, x2, y2 array.
/// @param {Real} cooldown how many frames/steps until another click can be registered with the same params
/// @returns {bool} usually used as part of an if statement in a Draw handler to run code when the player clicks something like a button
function point_and_click(rect, cooldown = 60)
```
Mouse Cursor Hover
```gml
/// @function scr_hit
/// @description Returns true if mouse is hovering on the specified rectangle area.
/// @returns {bool}
function scr_hit(x1=0, y1=0, x2=0, y2=0) 
```
Drawing an image from file
```gml
/// @description Draws a png image
/// For actual sprites with multiple frames, don't use this.
/// @param {String} path the file path after 'images' in the 'datafiles' folder. e.g. "creation/chapters/icons"
/// @param {Real} image_id the name of the image. Convention follows using numbers, e.g. "1.png", so that loops are useful, and it can be stored at it's own array index in the cache.
/// @param {Real} x1 the x coordinates to start drawing
/// @param {Real} y1 the y coordinates to start drawing
/// @param {Real} width the width of the image
/// @param {Real} height the height of the image
function scr_image(path, image_id, x1, y1, width, height)
/// @example
scr_image("creation/chapters/icons", 1, 450, 250, 32, 32); // draws the Dark Angels chapter icon at x 450 and y 250 at size 32x32px
```

Tooltips
```gml
/// creates a hover over tool tip at the given coordinate where:
/// x is the left most point of the tooltip box
/// y is the topmost point of the tooltip box,
/// tooltip_text is the text to display (text should be preformatted e.g string_hash_to_newline() to create lines)
function tooltip_draw(_tooltip="", _width=350, _coords=return_mouse_consts_tooltip(), _text_color=#50a076, _font=fnt_40k_14, _header="", _header_font=fnt_40k_14b, _force_width=false){
```

Company id to string
```gml
/// @function scr_convert_company_to_string
/// @description Accepts a number and adds an affix to convert it to ordinal form.
/// @param {real} company_num Company number.
/// @param {bool} possessive Add 's affix?
/// @param {bool} flavour Add company designation text (Veteran, Battle, Reserve, etc.)?
/// @returns {string}
function scr_convert_company_to_string(company_num, possessive = false, flavour=false)
/// @example
scr_convert_company_to_string(1, true, true); // 1st Veteran Company
scr_convert_company_to_string(7, true, true); // 7th Reserve Company
```


# How does combat work?????

-  First obj_ncombat is creates.
- second scr_battle_Roster is run with the location planet and star as arguments to collect player forces in battle

- within obj_ncombat create the obj_pnunit.alarm[3] is set to run for next step
	- this tallies up the total player forces in obj_encombat

- obj_ncombat.alarm[0] is set to run the turn after
	-	 this populates the enemy forces
	- it also bizzarly seems to set up some of the player defences

- obj_ncombat.alarm[1] runs a turn after alarm[0] this sets up teh opening text for the confrontation, most of which it seems is there but the player never sees

- obj_ncombat.alarm[2] runs this sets ally forces curiously setting them up after their existane has been announced to the player by alarm[1]

- once the game has finished it's fade in the player can then click to start the game as defined in obj_ncombat.keypress_13 line 57-66

- this sets obj_ncombat.timer_stage to 1

- once obj_ncombat.timer_stage == 1 the following happens obj_ncombat.keypress_13 line 81-113

	- a bunch of alarms are set to run over the next 4 frames in this order

	- obj_pnunit.alarm[1]=1;
    - obj_enunit.alarm[1]=2;
    - obj_enunit.alarm[0]=3;

  - obj_pnunit.alarm[1] sets the player weapons stacks why this is done shere is beyond me

 - obj_enunit.alarm[1] collects the various data about the dudes in each row

 - obj_enunit.alarm[1] is the enemy physically attacking
 -  kicks of scr shoot and scr flavour by extension


- then the timer_stage goes to 2 

- while the timer stage is 2 it is waiting for a kerpress defined in obj_ncombat.keypress_13 which kicks of obj_ncombat.alarm[8]

- obj_ncombat.alarm[8] is a timer that kicks the timer_stage up to 3

- now timer_stage is 3

- fllowing alarms are set to run in this order again in obj_ncombat.keypress_13
	- obj_pnunit.alarm[3]
	- obj_pnunit.alarm[1]
	- obj_pnunit.alarm[0]

- obj_pnunit.alarm[3] runs to make new death company and also to determine if there is no point the player attacking because they dont have the armour piercing to cause damage
	- this is probably a problem file


- obj_pnunit.alarm[1] will now run after a key has been pressed officially beggining the battle this runs the scr_player_combat_weapon_stacks() for each obj_pnunit instance (e.g each red line on teh battle map)

- obj_pnunit.alarm[0] utilises the data from obj_pnunit.alarm[1] to acctually set player

- timer_stage = 4 

- this is functionally the same as timer_stage being 2 it's just a wating point to go to timer stage 1/5 (i giess sometimes the enmey can go twice?)

- this malarky continues unil there are either no active enunit or pnunit objects remaining

- at this point the obj_ncombat variable started i set to either 2 or 4 

- this then sets up another timer in obj_ncombat.keypress_13 whch runs 
	obj_pnunit.alarm[4]
     obj_pnunit.alarm[5]

- basically these are the summery collection of the battle scripts

- also runs obj_enunit.alarm[1] if the player lost

-  obj_ncombat.alarm[5] then runs to display the data collected by running the above

- onec the player has clicked through this  the started variable goes to 3 and

	- obj_pnunit.alarm[6]
	- obj_ncombat.alarm[7]

are run in that order

- battle is now complete
