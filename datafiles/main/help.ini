topic=Adepta Sororitas
info=Also known as the Sisters of Battle, they are an all-female division of the Imperial Cult.  They serve as the Ecclesiarchy`s fighting arm.
strategy=The Adepta Sororitas do not approve of any corruption or heresy, real or not.  If you were to find a holy relic, and grant it to them, they would be grateful for its return.
main_info=The Battle Sisters of the Adepta Sororitas are the mainstay of the Adeptus Ministorum`s armies. Equipped and trained to the highest Imperial standards, the Sisters of Battle specialize in waging Wars of Faith and purging heresy wherever it may be found. Because of this, its duties often overlap with the Ordo Hereticus of the Inquisition and as a result the Sisters of Battle maintain a close alliance with the Witch Hunters. The Sisters of Battle themselves are divided into six Orders, each numbering tens of thousands of Battle Sisters, and many Orders Minoris, each containing thousands of Sisters themselves. These forces are rarely deployed in full-strength, rather being assigned to waging Wars of Faith, aiding the Inquisition, or protecting Ecclesiarchy buildings, property, and relics.  Wherever possible the Sisters of Battle use the holy trinity of weapons, that of the bolter, flamer, and melta.  The terms "Adepta Sororitas" and "Sisters of Battle" are commonly assumed to mean the same thing, but the latter title technically refers only to the Orders Militant.

topic=Artifacts
info=Artifacts, also known as Relics, are ancient weapons from forgotten times.  They tend to be exceptionally well crafted and quite powerful, but may have also been tained by Chaos over the many millenia.
strategy=Artifacts, once detected, may be aquired by the landing of any of your forces onto the planet in question.  They may be equipped to your marines to increase their destructive potential.  Other artifacts may not be used, but instead offer chapter-wide bonuses.  You may wish to generously gift an artifact to another faction- if the artifact in question is not of terrible quality this will likely boost relations and disposition.  Note if the artifact is Chaos or, Emperor forbid, Daemon possessed, as this might change how thankful a gifted faction might be.

topic=Ecclesiarchy
info=The official state church of the Imperium of Man which maintains and promotes the worship of the Emperor of Mankind as the one, true God of Humanity.
strategy=The Ecclesiarchy does not approve of corruption, be it real or not.
main_info=The core of the Ecclesiarchy`s spiritual and temporal power is the Cult Imperialis, also known variously as the Imperial Creed or Imperial Cult. The foundation of the Cult Imperialis is the belief in and worship of the Emperor as a divine being, the power of the Emperor to intercede in matters spiritual and temporal, the power of prayer to bring about a change in circumstances, and the divine right of Mankind to rule the stars. The Adeptus Ministorum also administers and spreads the Imperial Cult throughout the territory of the Imperium.  Though any Imperial religious cult or sect must ultimately adhere to the core theology of the Imperial Creed, the possibility for conflicting interpretation means that in practice the Cult Imperialis is an agglomeration of many differing schools of thought. Whilst agreeing in essence, cults and sects across the galaxy often differ on particular tenets of belief or modes of worship. To many the Emperor is a God of War, to others a saviour and bringer of light, and to some a stern judge of the dead. Inevitably, simple differences of emphasis of faith can become points of hostility and even the cause of bloodshed.

topic=Exterminatus
info=Exterminatus is the name of a terrible order given by the authorities of the Imperium of Man to destroy an entire planetary biosphere and all life upon a world.
strategy=A simple Space-Marine approved Exterminatus device may be purchased from the Inquisition, and then equiped into the 'Gear' slot on any of your marines.  If that marine raids a planet, and the battle is won, it will be consumed to turn that planet into a Dead World and kill all life on it.
main_info=Exterminatus is one of the many tools in the armoury of the Imperium, used in those cases where complete destruction is deemed a better solution than more subvert or conventional methods. The world in question may have fallen to Chaos worship, or its Imperial government overthrown and replaced by the rule of aliens such as Genestealers, or it may be a non-Imperial world harbouring an extraordinarily powerful and dangerous species of alien. Exterminatus is often resorted to when the world is deemed to be not worth the amount of men and material that would be required to conquer or reclaim it. Exterminatus is very rarely used on planets vital or valuable to the Imperium. It has also been used as a method of denying resources to alien invasion.  The Exterminatus order can be given by any Inquisitor, Space Marine Chapter Master, Lord High Admiral, or Lord Commander. The Imperial Navy usually resorts to mass bombardment. Space Marines prefer to plant a bomb on the surface. The Inquisition has access to more exotic weapons such as virus bombs and cyclonic torperdoes.

topic=Inquisition
info=The Inquisition is a secret organisation that exists outside the standard administrative hierarchy of the Imperium of Man. They act as the secret police force of the Imperium.
strategy=When offered a mission you should accept it in order to increase disposition.  The Inquisition is also more able to dispose of or use Chaos artifacts than other Imperial factions.
main_info=As the Inquisition possesses neither formal hierarchy nor leadership, each Inquisitor is free to pursue the mission of Humanity`s survival in the manner he or she believes most appropriate. Like-minded fellows gather together to investigate areas of mutual interest or concern, as bounded by one of the many Inquisitorial Ordos. Each Ordo waxes and wanes with the times, for many Inquisitors move freely between them according to where they judge the need to lie. The greater the level of daemonic activity, the larger the Ordo Malleus becomes; in times of heresy, the Ordo Hereticus grows to match the threat. An Ordo can lie fallow for years, existing only as a historical curio until its field of study becomes relevant once more. Such is the nature of the galaxy, however, that some perils –- specifically those posed by the Daemon, the alien and the heretic -– are ever-present. Accordingly, the Ordos dedicated to combating them – the Ordo Malleus, the Ordo Xenos and the Ordo Hereticus – are considered Ordos Majoris, for their vigil is never-ending. Nevertheless, there are many scores of Ordos Minoris as well, lesser branches dedicated to more transient dangers.

topic=Missions
info=Though Adeptus Astartes are independant, other factions betimes will ask a Chapter to undertake a challenging mission that they themselves are not capable of doing.
strategy=Completing Missions for other factions has a chance of increasing Disposition for that faction, and occasionally offers other, additional rewards.  The actual missions are quite varied but are almost all completable by raiding, attacking, purging, or landing a couple of marines on the world in question.  When in doubt read the Mission Popup carefully and review the Event Log entry.

topic=Plasma Bomb
info=Plasma Bombs are a type of destructive, explosive weapon used for damaging ships of planet features.
strategy=A Plasma Bomb may be constructed in the armoury,  and then equipped in the 'Gear' slot on any of your marines.  If they succesfully win in ground combat enemy planetary features will be destroyed or deactivated.  They may be used in the same way in boarding actions- if your marine participates in boarding an enemy ship, and has a plasma bomb, they will carry out a mission based upon what you have chosen in 'Chapter Settings'.
main_info=Plasma Bombs are Plasma Weapons designed to be used by Imperial Starhawk bombers to assault enemy capital ships during void combat. When a Starhawk comes in close for its bombing run on a starship`s hull, it will often drop flurries of these plasma warheads from its mid-bay bomb-firing cylinders. However, larger forms of Plasma Bombs have also been known to be dropped or placed into position on planets, often as part of an orbital bombardment or Exterminatus action.

topic=Spyrers
info=Spyrers (or Spyre Hunters) are a subsect of the high nobility from the hive world of Necromunda and other similar planets.
strategy=These men and women are incredibly armed, armoured, and vicious, yet are of flesh and blood.  If presented with overwhelming enemy numbers they will use stealth.
main_info=Within the industrial underhives of a hive city, where the gangs of the ruling houses compete for the scarce resources, the upper nobility also commit their own groups of "gangs" to underhive conflicts for a different purpose.  Spyrer groups are composed of the unproven youths of the noble houses born in the upper levels of the hive where they have known little want or hardship. These groups then descend into the lower levels to undertake a vow that has been impressed upon them by a sponsor Patriarch or Matriarch, either to survive unaided in the depths of the undercity for a designated length of time, or to obtain a designated number of kills. They are not permitted to return until their task is complete.  In this way unproven individuals of the noble houses will prove themselves as ruthless and resourceful and thus suited for leadership roles.  Occasionally some individuals gain such a taste for the hunt that they return to the underhive as part of other Spyrer hunts, or they sponsor future groups as Patriarchs or Matriarchs.  Each Spyrer is granted a unique Hunting Rig which has been crafted offworld using nearly forgotten technologies.

topic=STC
info=The Standard Template Construct (STC) systems were complex analytical and processing systems created during the Dark Age of Technology. They are said to have contained the entirety of human technological knowledge up to that point.
strategy=If a STC Fragment is detected on a planet, you may then land Techmarines or Techpriests in order to acquire it.  This STC Fragment may then be identified by your chapter to try and discover forgotten technological secrets (possibly gaining chapter-wide benefits or new equipment options) or gifted to another faction for a Disposition increase.
main_info=In the Age of the Imperium, working STCs are practically unknown. The recovery of fragments of an STC or the templates used in one is the primary focus of the Adeptus Mechanicus`s quest for knowledge. Part of this quest is also to find, collate and utilise STC print-outs. The STC is their equivalent to the font of all knowledge (which is exactly what it was intended to be). Ancient recovered print-outs from STCs are regarded as sacred texts. The Mechanicus strives to recover as much information as possible from them, hoping to find new knowledge, weapons and technologies. Although the most advanced technological information eludes the Adeptus Mechanicus, through their efforts, much has been either recovered or reconstructed through comparison of copies.
