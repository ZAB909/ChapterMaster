## Running the game locally and developing

0. Ensure you have [GameMaker](https://gamemaker.io/en/download) installed.
1. Clone the repo.
2. Open ChapterMaster.yyp with GameMaker.
3. In GameMaker, click the Run button or press F5 to build the project and start the game. The game will then run inside a web app managed by GameMaker, which should also open a new tab in your browser. 
	- If no new tab opens check the output log in GameMaker, there should be a line like this:\
	  _Attempting to open browser - "" with URL "http://localhost:51264/runner.html?game=ChapterMaster"._ \
      Use the link to open the game instance.
4. Play the game!
5. (Optional) Read the code, modify it, test, repeat.

CM does not currently use any external dependencies expect GameMaker.

For code changes, you can use any text editor you like, just remember to periodically compile and test in GameMaker.

If you are new to Git, then we recommend reading [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2). You only need to read the first 3 chapters to comfortably work with Git, optionally chapter 6 to get more info on GitHub. If you prefer a GUI based approach to Git, then we recommend one of the below:
- [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/) + [tutorials](https://www.gitkraken.com/learn/git/tutorials)
- [Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) + [tutorials](https://confluence.atlassian.com/get-started-with-sourcetree)

Both are free and popular. 

## Exporting and creating packages

Creating a package (i.e. creating an .exe with the game) unfortunately requires a GameMaker's Creator paid subscription. If you don't have one, you will only be able to test the game locally and upload the source code and any assets to the repo. 

However, periodically we do create packages from this repo's _main_ branch, so even if you do not have a licence, any changes that you make, publish and get successfully merged to this repo will get exported at some point and the created package will be hosted on a server somewhere, for players to download, play and enjoy. 

[GameMaker subscriptions comparison](https://gamemaker.io/en/get) - you need the Desktop Exports option to create the .exe.\
[Setting up GameMaker export for Windows](https://help.yoyogames.com/hc/en-us/articles/235186048-Setting-Up-For-Windows) - if you have a subscription which allows for creating executables, this link will help you setup the process.
